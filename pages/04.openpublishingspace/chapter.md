[Grav Open Blogging (Publishing) Space Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space) with [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) is designed to publish, share and collaboratively edit Markdown-based content using the modern flat-file Grav CMS.

One or more Open Blogging Space pages can also be embedded into another system (i.e. LMS) with the 'Chromeless Pages' option, which hides global navigation elements.
