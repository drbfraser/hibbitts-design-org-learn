# Grav Gantry 5 Particles and Atoms

Both the [OER Content Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-oer-content-space) and [ePortfolio Blog](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-eportfolio-blog) skeleton packages use a number of custom Gantry [Particles](http://docs.gantry.org/gantry5/particles). These particles may also be installed and used with any Grav Gantry 5 themes, including commercial themes by [RocketTheme](rockettheme.com/grav/themes/).
