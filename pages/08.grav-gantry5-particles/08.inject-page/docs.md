The ['Inject Page' Particle](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-gantry5-atom-hypothesis) displays a single Grav page.

#### Download the Gantry 5 Particle
* Download and unzip the ['Inject Page' Paticle archive](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-gantry-particle-inject-page/archive/master.zip).

#### Installing the Particle

Before installing and using the Particle, it is suggested you temporarily enable Gantry's [`Development Mode`](http://docs.gantry.org/gantry5/configure/extras)

1. Open the folder for your active theme in the `user/data/gantry5/themes/` folder of your Gantry installation. For example, if you are using the Helium theme open the folder `user/data/gantry5/themes/g5_helium`.
2. If a `particles` folder already exists within the theme folder open it, otherwise create it.
3. Upload `inject_page.html.twig` and `inject_page.yaml` files into the `particles` folder. For example, if you are using the Helium theme copy the two particle files into `user/data/gantry5/themes/g5_helium/particles`.
